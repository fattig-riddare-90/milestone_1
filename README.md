## UX

### Project Goals

The goal of this project is to create a professional and user-friendly website for SHBJ Allservice, a company that provides skilled personnel for short- and long-term assignments. Since the company does not own trucks but instead offers workforce solutions, the website will clearly communicate the skills and services available.

### User Goals

    * Quickly determine if SHBJ Allservice provides the required competencies.
    * Easily find contact information, including a contact form and phone number for urgent inquiries.
    * Navigate the website smoothly and efficiently, without unnecessary distractions. 

### Owner Goals

    * Present the company in a professional manner to potential business partners.
    * Make it easy for visitors to get in touch for inquiries or collaborations.
    * Ensure a clear and structured layout that reflects the company's reliability and efficiency.

### Developer Goals

    * Demonstrate an understanding of the concepts covered in the course by applying them in a real-world project.
    * Build a structured and professional website using HTML and CSS.
    * Ensure good readability, maintainability, and best practices in coding.
    * Utilize Git and GitHub for version control to document progress.
    * Deploy the project using GitHub Pages to make it publicly accessible.

### User Stories

    1. As a business owner or HR manager, I want to quickly see if SHBJ Allservice provides the personnel I need, so I can decide if I should reach out to them for more information.

    2. As a project manager, I want to access the contact details easily so I can get in touch with SHBJ Allservice for specific inquiries about available staff.

    3. As a potential partner, I want to find a clear list of the competencies offered by SHBJ Allservice, so I can assess whether they can meet my company's needs for temporary or long-term staffing.

    4. As a business owner or HR manager, I want to easily navigate the website and find relevant information without unnecessary steps, so I can save time and make decisions faster.

### Design Choices

The design of the website will follow a minimalist approach, focusing on clarity and ease of use. The color scheme will reflect the company’s brand, utilizing the company’s blue and orange colors for consistency and recognition. A company logo will be incorporated into the design to strengthen brand identity. The layout will prioritize simplicity and a professional look, ensuring that users can easily find the information they need without distractions.
